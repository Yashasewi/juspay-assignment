# Pixel-Perfect Implementation

Your implementation should match the Figma designs exactly. This includes layout, spacing, typography, colors, and alignment.
All UI components (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.) should be consistent with the design specifications.
Correct usage of fonts, font sizes, weights, colors, and styles as per the provided design.
Ensure that the final version implemented is also made responsive as per industry standard devices for desktop, tablet and mobile

## Code Quality and Best Practices

Your code should be well-organized, easy to navigate, and follow a logical structure.
Use reusable components and avoid duplicating code. Adhere to best practices like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Your code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to understand, with meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.
Focus on efficient rendering, minimal DOM manipulation, proper state management, lazy loading, and reducing unnecessary re-renders.
Make sure your implementation is accessible and follows accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus states).

## Motion and Microinteractions

Animations and microinteractions should add value to the user experience and not be distracting.
Ensure all animations are smooth with no lag or jank. This will be tested for frame drops and performance issues.
Your microinteractions should enhance usability (e.g., hover effects, button states, loading animations). They should be intuitive and provide a delightful experience.
Animations and interactions should be consistent with the overall design language and brand identity.

## Functionality

Filtering, Searching, Sorting, Pagination, Dark and light theme

## Documentation and Deployment

Provide clear documentation for your code, especially for components, functions, and modules.
Include clear instructions for setting up and running the project locally.
Deploy the application on a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages and provide a working demo link.

## Bonus Points (Optional)

Usage of advanced state management techniques (e.g., Redux, Context API) where appropriate and justified.
If you provide unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests using tools like Jest, React Testing Library, or Cypress.
